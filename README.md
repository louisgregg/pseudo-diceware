# pseudo-diceware
A password generator for lazy, paranoid people.  
In fact, even calling this pseudo-diceware is a stretch. It's more like a random word selector.   
You can find an *evil, password stealing implementation* of this code here:

## Random Number Generation
Random numbers generated by an instance of the SystemRandom class in the random library.   
https://pynative.com/cryptographically-secure-random-data-in-python/  
I chose to use this instead of the secrets library (available from Python 3.6 onwards) for backwards compatibility.  
The documentation for random recommends using the SystemRandom class for crypto applications. See here:  
https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html
